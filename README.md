# Lenta_Hack DeepHunch, 2020
## Skoltech,HackLab Course

These notebooks are provided in frames of Lenta Hackathon during HackLab Course at Skoltech. The descriptions of the presented data can be found below.

1. The first two notebooks ```Visualization.ipynb``` and partially ```Vizualization_and_Time_Series.ipynb``` consist of a short visualization of the datasets. As the dataset was huge we splited this task.
2. Also the second notebook ```Vizualization_and_Time_Series.ipynb``` provides simple illustrations of time series predictions with ARIMA model. The result showed that for effective prediction more complicated model is needed.
3. Notebook ```Time_series_clustering_model.ipynb``` contains time series clusterization for bills time series of clients. The result is that due to low computational resources, the testing remains unfinished.
